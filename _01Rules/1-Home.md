**General Rules:**

Show a basic level of respect to all players and staff. Excessive trolling or minging will not be tolerated. Hacking, cheating, and exploiting will all result in severe punishment. Do not spam. (Ex: Mic, Chat, Props) Do not kill randomly; RDM is not tolerated.

**FailRP:**

FailRP is ultimately up to the admins. (Use common sense) Do not kill yourself to avoid an RP situation. Do not bait others using OOC..

**Basing:**

Cannot claim sidewalks as part of your property. Do not claim more than one property for yourself or your group. You cannot build/edit during an active home invasion. Your base must be possible to invade. Keypads must be visible, and not obstructed. There is a maximum of 4 fading doors in 1 base. (They must be realistic Example: A door prop) Your keypad "Access Granted" hold length must be 4 seconds or longer. You cannot kill someone for "Loitering" outside your base. You may not prop climb to get to certain parts of your base. (You can still build on a roof, so long as you can get there naturally). Hobos are an exception (hobo homes) You may not use your fading door hotkeys. (You must use the keypad itself) ; FDA Is not allowed.

**Home Invasions:**

You cannot kill people for simply being near a Home Invasion. However if a government official is near the Home Invasion you can fight them. (Ex: You cannot kill someone for trying to walk down the street with no intention of interfering because they are simply 'near' the invasion) Do not invade the same person(s) more than twice per hour. Invasions against the same party/individual must be separated by at least 15 minutes. You may not invade the PD without proper RP reason (Such as breaking a teammate out) You don't need to advert your invasion like most servers, but it is expected that you have a proper reason to do so if asked by staff. You may not return to the same invasion once you have died. (NLR - New Life Rule)

**Kidnapping/Mugging:**

Anyone who is being kidnapped/mugged may defend themselves. You may kill someone for running away from a kidnapping/mugging. (This does NOT include people who were already moving. They must be aware of your attempt to mug/kidnap them) The maximum you may demand for/from a person is $5,000. You cannot hold someone for more than 10 minutes. You must wait 15 minutes before mugging the same person.
