**[Wayshrines](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17905)**

Fast travel is TECHNICALLY in the game, however it's just not through the map anymore, instead the modpack uses [SWIFT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17905) SWIFT adds a network of wayshrines across the world of Skyrim, Dawnguard, and Dragonborn that allows players to instantly travel from one wayshrine to another in a more lore-friendly way. The mod is balanced by forcing players to have to locate a wayshrine before they can gain access to its location for teleportation. The locations of the wayshrines are also not too close to major locations but close enough to maintain convenience. This also encourages the player to be more adventurous in their explorations.

SWIFT's fast travel method is instantaneous. This means that there is ZERO time transition when teleporting from point A to point B. This is to compliment mods that add survival-like elements such as hunger, thirst, fatigue, weather conditioning, etc. No longer will you need to worry about sped up needs rates!

Delve into the mysterious findings of a great scholar who had an infatuation with ancient mer culture and technology. Learn of his work, discover lost information, unveil the secrets behind the wayshrines, and learn how one could possibly use this knowledge to their advantage. Enemies you are forced to fight during this quest are trivial, any others you may come across can be rushed past. This quest is about an hour long, more or less. No quest markers are available, but enough information is provided for clues as to where to go/what to do next.

The answers you are given at the end of the main quest only create more questions. By testing the incomplete theory of a well renowned conjurer, you conclude that there is an entire new dimension awaiting to be explored for answers. This quest has no markers but is very short.
During the events of the main quest, you can come across a book that reveals explicit hints to all wayshrine locations with images and descriptions, except for the few optional wayshrines (the book's author makes note as to why this is).

-While technically not fast travel, it is a very fast way to get around and is great for exploring, especially when paired with the Tarhiel's Gale spell which allows you to get up in the air from wherever you are every 5 minutes.
