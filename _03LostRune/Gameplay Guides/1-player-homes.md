**[Sky Haven Temple](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9880)**

This is a full visual overhaul of the interior of Skyhaven temple. On top of changing what was there in vanilla, it also adds two new rooms, A players quarters and a library with lots of bookshelves, storage areas, and unique displays. The player home is also quite cool in that it comes equip with a fully functional unique armor display and weapon display for Dragonbane
and Oathblade.
 
The changes to the temple are also respectful to the lore of the area as well. For example, when you first get there it will look wildly grown over with foliage, be full of old boxes, and look pretty shitty, relatively speaking. Once you progress a bit in the story line, the new additions will be added as they were in the vanilla game, and the doors to the new rooms will be unlocked as well.

**[Crypt of the Old Guard](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11011)**

Backstory:
Once a crypt for the original Dawnguard, now turned into a vampire lair.

Features:
Vampire Cattle for feeding: killing one will spawn another, up to 6 total
New Blood Transmuter station that allows you to craft blood potions
Toggle lights on and off
Toggle an additional room to serve as follower quarters: alter layout by toggling between beds, coffins, or benches
Unique smelter
Craft vampire armor, basic steel crossbows, and steel bolts at the forge
Custom and vanilla storage containers to suit your preference
4 mannequins, 2 weapon plaques, 2 dagger display cases, 3 bookcases, and a single bookshelf  

Location:
Just south of Riften, down the hill from the Shadow Stone (see images). The home will appear on your map when you install the mod, but you'll have to discover it to be able to fast travel there.

How to open the secret armory room:
There are 3 small pressure plates behind the archery target in the armory. Hit the one that is farthest to the right. Arrows, bolts, and some spells (flames, sparks, etc.) can trigger the pressure plate. View the images section for a visual tutorial. Inside the room is a pull chain so you can close it without having to mess with the pressure plate again.

**[Abandonded Castle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565)**

**[Hunters Cabin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1783)**

The Hunter's Cabin of Riverwood is a lore friendly, free player home that's available to all players, almost as soon as you start the game. The perfect mod for those who want a beautiful, simple yet functional house from the very beginning, without feeling that you're ruining, or going against the lore.

This is NOT the ultimate player house, for the simple reason that it's not supposed to be.

How do I get it?

Simple, just look on the front porch for a note from the owner.  It will direct you to Embershard Mine (the first "Mine" icon that appears on your compass when you escape from Helgen). Once inside the mine, fight your way to the treasure room (you can't miss it), there you will find a key named "Hunter's Cabin Key" and a Bandit Report (if your interested in the background story). Finish the dungeon and exit through the rear entrance, once outside just continue towards Riverwood.

**[Skaal You Need](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41475?tab=description)**

Buy the house from Hannah in the Skaal village Greathall for 7 000 gold. She is VERY persistent until you buy it >:)
You can find the follower, Wynter, at the same location, she will follow you immediately, regardless of you progression with the Dragonborn DLC. 
Same with the house, you don't need anything special.

If Hannah doesn't talk to you, just quicksave and quickload in the Greathall and she should wake up from her coma.

Inside the house you will find a book: Skaal Recipes.
Having the book in your inventory when smithing will allow you to craft the Skaal armour and the horker tusk bow.
So reading the book does nothing. Without the book you won't see the crafting recipes, they show up at the forge when you have the book with you, this is to prevent unnecessary clutter in the smithing menus when you have many mods adding recipes.
