## **Modpack Summary**
**Created By: McTiddies4Lunch**

Lost Runes is a semi-hardcore survival mod pack focused created by McTiddies4Lunchon enhancing all aspects of gameplay and role play. From arrow wounds causing you to bleed, or tougher enemies, or even hunger and thirst, you may struggle to survive at first. The harsh, beautiful world of Skyrim will only make you stronger and draw you further in as you level up and ascend to being **THE DRAGONBORN**.

## **Notice**

This page and its associated pages will serve as the main pages for the list until a proper restructure and design can be made to the site. This restructure will include a new domain and a less Capital Punishment focused home page/side navigation bar
