## **Tweaks**

Gameplay tweaks as well as mod configuration settings are extremely important for tailoring the game to how you would like to play.* In addition, they can help fix overlaps between multiple mod/in game key binds. Please refer to the list below to change the proper key binds to help minimize this overlap. Below these key bind changes will also be a full compilation of tweaks and what they do alongside our very own @Kragos#2049 tweaks list.

## **MAPMO HUD Keybinds**

- HUD Quest Log: SHIFT+J

## **Controller Binds**

 - It is suggested you either have an XInput Controller (Xbox Controller; So Far Have only Tested Xbox 360 Functioning Properly) or a program which spoofs non Xinput Controllers [(IE: DS4 Windows)](https://ds4-windows.com)
