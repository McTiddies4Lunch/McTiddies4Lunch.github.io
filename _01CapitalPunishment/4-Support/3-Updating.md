## **Updating**

- With Wabbajack the updating process is relatively simple

{: .important}
> Make sure to have the newest version of Wabbajack installed, your Capital Punishment directories in the correct locations, etc.

- Open Wabbajack and find the Capital Punishment list. Set your Installation and Download locations to what you did originally so that the update can overwrite

- Click the play button once this is all configured

- Open MO2 then send your Tale of Two Wastelands mod back up to the correct separator. You should not have to do this every update if the [NoDelete] prefix works for you

- You're officially done and can now launch your game through MO2. Some updates may require a new save, others may not. This will be clarified update to update.
