# **Traditional Method**

**Step 1:** First, from The Mall make your way East towards the Capitol Building then North towards the National Archives.

**Step 2:** Next, your destination is the Penn. Ave/The Mall Metro which is located behind the Archives.

**Step 3:** Once inside the metro, continue straight down the hall and on to the elevated platform (mind the feral ghouls). Direct your gaze over the side of the platform to the right/East. You will notice that one of the train tunnels is free of rubble.

**Step 4:** To continue on to the station, take the exit at the end of the tunnel to Judiciary Square Metro (yes, this is a new area) which will lead you to a new DC mall area. With a little bit of exploration you will find the station building. Additionally, here is an overhead composite map of the layout of The Mall with the Penn. Ave./The Mall dungeon highlighted in yellow.

# **How to Travel from the Mojave to Capital**

**Step 1:** To get to the train, travel to Freeside North and head over to the Mormon Fort

**Step 2:** Continue past the Mormon Fort, down the street and under the overpass.

# **Buying the Military Truck Base**

- Find Crazy Wolfgang as he travels through the wastes & Buy the Prospectors Pack for 1500 Caps
> He Loops through Canterbury Commons, Temple of the Union, Agatha's house, Paradise Falls, Arefu, Evergreen Mills, Megaton, and Rivet City

- I would suggest purchasing as much Flamer Fuel as you can afford (I put about 1000 into the tank for reference but not sure of the exact number needed as of yet)

- Travel to the Scrapyard (Where Dogmeat is)

- Unlock the MTB using the key from the pack, then go to the glovebox at the front and grab the travel guide

- After doing this, dump your fuel into the truck. Activate the GPS and "Travel West".
