## **TTW Stock Exchange**

[Link to Nexus Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/79488)

**Description**

This is a revised and rebuilt edition of the old mod of the same name. The entire mod has been reworked from the ground up. The price of stocks are now easier to track and are no longer purchased from vendors, but instead can be bought directly using your pipboy by clicking on a radio station, or if you prefer something more immersive, from brokerage terminals placed in the wasteland. The prices of the stocks update daily and their rise (or fall) is influenced by the quests you complete and the deaths of relevant NPCs. Unlike the old mod, the actions you take don't immediately change the value of a stock. Instead, your actions impact whether a stock is trending upwards or downwards.

## **Working on the Chain Gang**

[Link to Nexus Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/74958)

**Description:**

As it stands, the Powder Ganger faction in New Vegas has little content for anyone not interested in ransacking a small town or pissing off an entire government for little gain.  For most other characters, these dynamite-armed ex-cons are reduced to an occasional roadblock to stomp on in the early game.  That said, New Vegas does touch on the fact that not all these escaped prisoners are interested in raiding; some merely stick with the gang for safety or the lack of better options. I decided to expand on that concept and created a group of Powder Gangers more interested in redemption than raiding.

Working on the Chain Gang centers around a new group of Powder Gangers who want to carve out a place for themselves in the Mojave, and turn over a new leaf in the process.  The quest chain is thus more suited for neutral to good aligned characters, although a pragmatic evil player could also justify their involvement for the pay.  This group won't be hostile to you even if you are Vilified by the other Powder Gangers, and helping them will even improve your reputation!

Working on the Chain Gang is a Powder Ganger-centric quest mod designed to begin in the early game, when the player is being introduced to the chain gang, and ends in the midgame.  That said, the mod can still be started and finished if installed on an ongoing playthrough, with a minor hiccup if the player has already wiped out NCRCF.  Nothing major, but some optional objectives will be impossible to do.

**Features**
- A new reformist Powder Ganger faction based in Westside
- Faction presence increases as the player does quests for them, including a new store and patrols
- Ties into the vanilla reputation system without locking out players
- Multiple fully voiced characters
- New weapons with unique textures (as of v1.5)!
- Offers a reason for non-evil characters to begin "I Fought The Law"

**Location**
- Goodsprings Source

**How to Start**
- Find a man named Whitmeyer at Goodsprings Source.
