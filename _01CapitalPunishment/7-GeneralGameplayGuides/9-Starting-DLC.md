## **Starting the DLC for Fallout: New Vegas** 

|DLC|How to Start|
|--|--|
|**Dead Money**|The radio broadcast reaches to about Helios One and needs to be listened to for the quest to start|
|**Honest Hearts**|The radio broadcast reaches down to Freeside and needs to be listened to for the quest to start|
|**Old World Blues**|The radio broadcast has a fairly small radius around the Mojave Drive-In, and once you pick up the signal, the quest is started. Once you complete OWB and return to Vegas, the radio broadcast will regain its vanilla Mojave-wide range, for those who like the music|
|**Lonesome Road**|Completing the other 3 DLCs' main quests will automatically start the quest with a message from Ulysses, but you may also simply walk to the Canyon Wreckage to begin the quest whenever you'd like|
|**GRA/Pre-Order Packs**|There's nothing to start, but the mod removes the popup messages informing you the DLCs have been installed|

## **Starting Fallout 3's DLC**

|**The Pitt**|The radio broadcast reaches to about Oasis and needs to be listened to for the quest to start|
|**Operation Anchorage**|The radio broadcast is active within the ruins surrounding Bailey's Crossroads and needs to be listened to for the quest to start|
|**Broken Steel**|Automatically starts after completing the main quest (note that TTW 3.3 plays the original game's ending if you complete it in Hardcore mode and activate the purifier yourself)|
|**Point Lookout**|Walking south past the Citadel should start the quest when you get close enough to the Riverboat to hear the ship's horn|
|**Mothership Zeta**|The radio broadcast reaches to about the Scrapyard and needs to be listened to for the quest to start|
