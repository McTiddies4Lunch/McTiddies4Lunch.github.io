description: How is Fast Travel Handled?
---

Fast travel is in the game! But not how you think. Fast travel is one of the best, yet least immersive things about Fallout. However, now that is a thing of the past! There are several ways the player may fast travel which will be detailed below!

## **Transporters**

A faction of roaming wanderers, these people will take you from point A to point B â€“ for a few caps of course. They can be found at any and every settlement and offer 20 travel locations. Why not try them out, find their settlement, or even apply for a PREMIUM travel membership? 

## **Travelling with Caravans**

If you've got the caps, you can travel with any wandering or stationary caravan to their next stop(s). Be warned though, random events will occur when you do travel with them, all wildly varying. 

## **Military Truck Base**

Located in the Scrapyard in the Capital/Gibsons Scrapyard in the Mojave. For a measly 1500 caps, you can buy the Prospector's Pack from Wolfgang & live your dreams of  van life! This, of course, comes at the extra added cost of flamer fuel, which is the primary fuel source for the truck. And don't think that travelling to the Mojave immediately doesn't come at a cost. Benny will steal your truck, sell it to Old Lady Gibson, and you will have to buy it again.
