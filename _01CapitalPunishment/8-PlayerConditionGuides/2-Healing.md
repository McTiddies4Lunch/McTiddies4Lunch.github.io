## **Healing: An Introduction**

Healing is the essence of life in any Fallout game, but healing has been completely revamped in this mod. New healing items have replaced others, new sickness and diseases have been added, and food/water no longer heals health as it used to. Even worrying about light, moderate, and severe bleeding will be a part of your everyday struggle as you fight through the wastes. Below are all the items you will need to prepare yourself for this/what they do.

## **Bleeding**

Bleeding is proc'd when the player is hit for a certain amount of their health at one time or in a short period. This bleeding affect comes in three stages and can be alleviated in two different ways

- **Bandages:** Removes one level of bleeding at a time
- **Trauma Kits:** Removes all levels of bleeding at one time

### **By Default, Bleeding is Set to the Values Below**

|Bleed Level|Amount of Health Lost|
|--|--|
|Minor|5%|
|Severe|20%|
|Critical|40%|

### **What We Recommend/Put in Our Preconfigured Save** 

|Bleed Level|Amount of Health Lost|
|--|--|
|Minor|15%|
|Severe|40%|
|Critical|60%|

## **Tweaked Healing Items**

|Healing Item|Associated Tweak(s)|
|--|--|
|**Blood Pack**|Restores 36 health over 12 seconds, damages rads by 24 over 12 seconds, is now marked as medicine to benefit from the medicine skill, and it returns an Empty Blood Pack|
|**Doctor's Bag**|Buffed to restore 54 limb health over 18 seconds, and reduces Agility for 36 seconds. Fast metabolism grants faster limb healing, but no bonus to healed limb condition|
|**Auto-Inject Stimpak**|Now the Combat Ultra-Stim|
|**Auto-Inject Stimpak**|Restores 20 health and 50 sleep deprivation immediately, increases health by 20, Agility and Perception by 1, AP regen by 25%, and attack/movement speed by 10% for 120 seconds, but it reduces your sleep deprivation by 1 each second, for 175 seconds|
|**Auto-Inject Stimpak**|Carries the same withdrawal as the Combat Stim, at about twice the likelihood|
|**Auto-Inject Stimpak**|Can be diluted into 3 regular Combat Stims, or condensed from 3 Combat Stims and an Empty Syringe|
|**Auto-Inject Stimpak**|Has an option for distribution throughout the wastes. Unlike the other items, this setting can be set to 0 and turned off, leaving the stim only in LR locations|
|**Auto-Inject Super Stimpak**| Now the Ultra-Stimpak|
|**Auto-Inject Super Stimpak**|Buffed to restore twice as much health as the Super Stimpak and increase health by 50 for two minutes, after which your health is reduced by 30 for an additional minute. It also carries a moderate food/hydration penalty, as well as a short sleep deprivation restoration, but a much steeper sleep deprivation penalty over time, all of which take place over 4/5 seconds|
|**Auto-Inject Super Stimpak**|Crafting recipe requires a Super Stimpak, Stimpak, Leather Belt, and an Antivenom|


## **New Healing Items**

|Healing Item|What it Does|
|--|--|
|**Basic Bandage**|Heals 15 health over 15 seconds. Heals 10 bonus health over 10 seconds if you're not in combat. Basic, but it won't count toward Overdose, and it's light and relatively easy to find. Bandages will stop BLEED's bleeding effect if you're afflicted by it|
|**Military Bandage**|Heals 25 health over 25 seconds, but it reduces Agility by 1 while it heals. Heals 10 bonus health over 10 seconds if you're not in combat. Rarer, but better Bandage. Comes with an Agility penalty to account for it's better healing|
|**Antiseptic**|Grants 10% bonus healing for 45 seconds. It's more for use in Medkit crafting recipes than individual use. It will apply to food healing|
|**Improvised Hemostat Pill**|Grants 25% reduced limb damage for 240 seconds. **Survival 20 or Medicine 20 for visibility + 20 Science to craft**|
|**Improved Hemostat Pill Crafting**|Requires: Tin Can, Buffout, Healing Powder, Purified Water; Recipe grants 6 pills. Marked as a food item, so it scales with Survival|
|**Solvitol (Painkillers)**|Provides +12% DR for 200 seconds, damages dehydration by 15. Commonly used for Improvised and Survival Medkits. Has no addiction, but it will increase the likelihood of a Med-X addiction if you take it while on Solvitol. Does not stack with Med-X|
|**Splint**|Grants a small amount of limb healing|
|**Army Morphine Syrette**|Grants 90 seconds of ignored crippled limbs, reduces strength for 90-120 seconds. Weaker version of Med-X, with a lower addiction chance than Med-X in my Indigestibles mod. Valuable for their weight in resale. **Medicine 25 for visibility + 30 Medicine to craft**|
|**Army Morphine Syrette Crafting**|Requires: Empty Syringe, Med-X, Surgical Tubing, Purified Water|
|**Combat Stim**|Increases AP by 20, Agility by 1, +25% AP regen, and +10% movement speed for 120 seconds, but it increases your sleep deprivation by 55. Pretty useful. Has a low addiction chance, and a relatively low addiction penalty|
|**Improvised Medkit**|Restores 12 health over 4-5 seconds, restores 15 limb health over 5-3 seconds, and reduces Endurance and Strength for 30-45 seconds. It's not very strong, but it's a relatively cheap way to get your limbs off of crippled for a short time, and it's relatively easy to craft. Marked as a food item, so it benefits from the Survival skill. **Survival 15/Medicine 20 for visibility + Survival 20 to craft**|
|**Improvised Medkit Crafting**|Requires: Tin Can, Solvitol, Purified Water, Empty Syringe, Lunchbox, Antiseptic|
|**Survival Medkit**|Restores 24 health over 6-8 seconds, restores 25-30 limb health over 5-6 seconds, reduces limb damage by 25% for 2 minutes, and reduces Endurance and Strength for 30-45 seconds. A moderate improvement on the Improvised Medkit for Survival players. Also marked as a food item. **Survival 30/Medicine 20 for visibility + Survival 35 to craft**|
|**Survival Medkit Crafting**|Requires: Tin Can, Solvitol x2, Purified Water, Empty Syringe, Lunchbox, Improvised Hemostat Pill x2|
|**Small Medkit**|Restores 24 health over 4-5 seconds, restores 30 limb health over 3-10 seconds, and reduces Endurance for 30-40 seconds. Not as much direct healing as just using the healing ingredients on their own, but having them all together along with the scalpel, grants you some moderate limb healing. **Medicine 25 for visibility + Medicine 25 to craft**|
|**Small Medkit Crafting**|Requires: Stimpak, Bandage, Antiseptic, Scalpel|
|**Army Medkit**|Restores 30-36 health over 5-6 seconds, restores 60 limb health over 6-10 seconds, grants +5 DR for 25-30 seconds, lets you ignore crippled limbs for 60 seconds, and reduces Endurance for 50 seconds. Moderate improvement to healing, substantial improvement to limb healing over the Small Medkit, grants DR and the Med-X effect, but it requires more items, and the Splint means that the Endurance penalty doesn't get reduced by Fast Metabolism. **Medicine 30 for visibility + Medicine 35 to craft**|
|**Army Medkit Crafting**|Requires: Stimpak, Military Bandage, Antiseptic, Scalpel, Splint, Army Morphine Syrettes|
|**Scientific Medkit**|Restores 48 health over 8-12 seconds, restores 40 limb health over 10-20 seconds, reduces rads by 30 over 5-6 seconds, and reduces Endurance for 40-50 seconds. More health restoration than the Army Medkit, and it's Endurance penalty is reduced by Fast Metabolism, but the healing is slow, because it uses two bandages. **Medicine 40/Science 35 for visibility + Medicine 45 to craft**.
|**Scientific Medkit Crafting**|Requires: Stimpak, Bandage x2, Antiseptic, Scalpel, RadAway|
|**Field Medkit**|Restores 65 health over 5-13 seconds, restores 60 limb health over 6-10 seconds, grants +5 DR for 30 seconds, lets you ignore crippled limbs for 60 seconds, reduces rads by 36-42 over 6-7 seconds, and reduces Endurance for 75 seconds.Expensive to craft, expensive to buy, but it'll solve all your problems at once, and grants a small statistical bonus to each factor for having them all in such an expensive package. **Medicine 50/Science 35 for visibility + Medicine 55 to craft**|
|**Field Medkit Crafting**|Requires: Stimpak x2, Bandage, Antiseptic, Scalpel, RadAway, Preserved Blood Pack, Army Morphine Syrettes, Splint|
|**Blood Draw Kit**|Damages health by 36, reduces Endurance for 3 minutes, and it damages your FOD and H2O by 55, but it grants a Blood Pack, an Empty Syringe, and a Scissors. Provides the same amount of health damage as a blood pack returns. **Medicine 25 for visibility + Medicine 35 to craft, while holding an empty blood pack**|
|**Blood Draw Kit Crafting**|Requires: Empty Syringe, Surgical Tubing, Scissors, Empty Blood Pack|
|**Preserved Blood Draw Kit**|Grants a Preserved Blood Pack. Just as easy to craft, if you know that you can use a Rad-X for preservation. **Medicine 40 for visibility + Medicine 35 to craft, while holding an Empty Blood Pack**|
|**Preserved Blood Draw Kit Crafting**|Requires: Blood Draw Kit Ingredients + An extra Rad-X on top of the regular Blood Draw Kit|
|**Preserved Blood Pack**|Doesn't deal any rad damage, making it a solid healing item & scales with medicine|
